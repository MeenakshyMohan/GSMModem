#
# Installation & Usage: 
#
# Verify that the cellular module is exposing the MBIM interface over the USB interface. 
# Use mbimcli to check status for the cellular connection and enter the PIN code if necessary. 
# Configure mbim-network.conf and place in /etc/ (example file included in the archive, check link bellow for details).
# https://www.freedesktop.org/software/libmbim/man/latest/mbim-network.1.html
# Start the mbim data connection with command:
# mbim-network <MBIM-INTERFACE> start
# Ensure execution of mbim-set-ip script with sufficient system priviledges
# ./mbim-set-ip <MBIM-INTERFACE> <NETWORK-INTERFACE>
#
# Examples:
# mbimcli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 -p --query-device-caps
# mbimcli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 -p --enter-pin=1234
# mbim-network /dev/cdc-wdm0 start
# ./mbim-set-ip /dev/cdc-wdm0 wwan0
#
# You should now be able to ping over the data connection.
# IP v4 ping: (only if IPv4 address was acquired from cellular module)
# ping -4 -I wwan0 8.8.8.8
# ping -4 -I wwan0 google.com

# IP v6 ping: (only if IPv6 address was acquired from cellular module)
# ping -6 -I wwan0 2001:4860:4860::8888
# ping -6 -I wwan0 google.com
#
# The script relies on the linux tools mbimcli, ip, systemd-resolve
# (Tested on libmbim 1.16.0 running on Ubuntu 18.10 cosmic (development) with kernel version 4.15.0)
